  Implement a new tool which helps CSUN students plan their entire academic career based on their projected graduation year. This solves the problem of your progress to graduation not matching exactly with the recommended course catalog which can lead to confusion and unnecessary classes. It will be able to recommend a set of classes for remaining semesters, which is automatically generated and updated based on your DPR. It will not display professors or class codes, but rather the class names.
